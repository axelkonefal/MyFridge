## General info
The world is suffering from food waste. Everyday tons of expired food is being thrown to trashcan. The MyFridge app comes to help people managing their food stored in the household. The app comes with the barcode scanner that allows to quickly add the product the database. Newly added product with read barcode and manually added name, description etc. is then sent to the external online database. The next time when someone reads the same barcode the data (name, description etc.) is sent straight from the online database. The app also comes with the notification that reminds user of products with short expiry date.
